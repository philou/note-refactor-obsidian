# TODO Map

- ~~Write pseudo code~~
- ~~Create a walking skeleton~~
    - Call a method with the right 3 arguments
        - understand how to get the full active buffer text
          - Found something at: https://txt.binnyva.com/2021/08/get-current-file-content-in-obsidian/, reading HDD directly... not sure this is the best wy
          - Another way could be to get all the lines from the Editor, and then aggregate them
          - We are not really looking for all the text, but rather for the lines defining the footnotes
          - Do something like the noteRemainder in NRDoc
    - ~~implement the method to return the input~~
    - should I update the note content ? or should I call this after the templating?
        - noteContent: used for all refactors, better tested, 
            - BUT: THIS CONTENT IS USED TO DO A REPLACE IN ORIGINAL NOTE!
        - after templating: safer, no conflict
            - but: needs new tests
            - BUT: NEEDS TO BE CALLED IN ALL REFACTORS
    - ~~add a 'dumb' test (no footnote ref)~~
    - ~~build the plugin~~
    - ~~create a test vault~~
    - ~~test it on a test vault~~
- Test drive the different cases
